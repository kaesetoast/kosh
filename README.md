====

Kosh is an attempt to create a Ticket System / Bug Tracker with a strong focus on frontend development.

## Current State
Right now, this is just a pet project of mine to dive more into the angularjs framework. This will eventually turn into a useful application, but at the moment, kosh should not be considered stable in any way.

## Kosh - what kind of a name is that??
I needed to come up with a working title for this, so I named it after Ambassador Kosh from the TV Series [Babylon 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5). If you don't know it, make sure tu check it out, it is one of the greates Sci-Fi series I've ever watched. :-)
